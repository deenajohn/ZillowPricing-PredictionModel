# ZillowPricing-PredictionModel

This project uses Zillow's housing data to predict the cost of a house on the market. 

Conducted extensive EDA on over 80 features to build a linear regression model to predict prices. Considered OLS, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net models using Python with focus on variable selection. Further, explored model assumptions and experimented parameter tuning.
